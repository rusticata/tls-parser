# TLS Parser

A TLS parser, implemented with the [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom)
parser combinator framework.

The goal of this parser is to implement TLS messages analysis, for example
to use rules from a network IDS, for ex during the TLS handshake.

It implements structures and parsing functions for records and messages, but
need additional code to handle fragmentation, or to fully inspect messages.
Parsing some TLS messages requires to know the previously selected parameters.
See [the rusticata TLS parser](https://github.com/rusticata/rusticata/blob/master/src/tls.rs)
for a full example.

It is written in pure Rust, fast, and makes extensive use of zero-copy. A lot of care is taken
to ensure security and safety of this crate, including design (recursion limit, defensive
programming), tests, and fuzzing. It also aims to be panic-free.

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/rusticata/tls-parser)
and is part of the [Rusticata](https://github.com/rusticata) project.

## Parsing records

The main parsing functions are located in the [tls.rs](src/tls.rs) file. The entry functions are:
- `parse_tls_plaintext`: parses a record as plaintext
- `parse_tls_encrypted`: read an encrypted record. The parser has no crypto or decryption features, so the content
  will be left as opaque data.

# Examples

```rust
extern crate nom;
extern crate tls_parser;

use nom::{Err, IResult};
use tls_parser::parse_tls_plaintext;

let bytes : &[u8]= include_bytes!("../assets/client_hello_dhe.bin");
// [ 0x16, 0x03, 0x01 ... ];
let res = parse_tls_plaintext(&bytes);
match res {
    Ok((rem,record)) => {
        // rem is the remaining data (not parsed)
        // record is an object of type TlsRecord
    },
    Err(Err::Incomplete(needed)) => {
        eprintln!("Defragmentation required (TLS record)");
    },
    Err(e) => { eprintln!("parse_tls_record_with_header failed: {:?}",e); }
}
```

Note that knowing if a record is plaintext or not is the responsibility of the caller.

As reading TLS records may imply defragmenting records, some functions are
provided to only read the record as opaque data (which ensures the record is
complete and gives the record header) and then reading messages from data.

Here is an example of two-steps parsing:

```rust

// [ 0x16, 0x03, 0x01 ... ];
match parse_tls_raw_record(bytes) {
    Ok((rem, ref r)) => {
        match parse_tls_record_with_header(r.data, &r.hdr) {
            Ok((rem2,ref msg_list)) => {
                for msg in msg_list {
                    // msg has type TlsMessage
                }
            }
            Err(Err::Incomplete(needed)) => { eprintln!("incomplete record") }
            Err(_) => { eprintln!("error while parsing record") }
        }
    }
    Err(Err::Incomplete(needed)) => { eprintln!("incomplete record header") }
    Err(_) => { eprintln!("error while parsing record header") }
}
```

Some additional work is required if reading packets from the network, to support
reassembly of TCP segments and reassembly of TLS records.

For a complete example of a TLS parser supporting defragmentation and states, see the
[rusticata/src/tls.rs](https://github.com/rusticata/rusticata/blob/master/src/tls.rs) file of
the [rusticata](https://github.com/rusticata/rusticata) crate.

## State machine

A TLS state machine is provided in [tls_states.rs](src/tls_states.rs). The state machine is separated from the
parsing functions, and is almost independent.
It is implemented as a table of transitions, mainly for the handshake phase.

After reading a TLS message using the previous functions, the TLS state can be
updated using the `tls_state_transition` function. If the transition succeeds,
it returns `Ok(new_state)`, otherwise it returns `Err(error_state)`.

```rust

struct ParseContext {
    state: TlsState,
}

match tls_state_transition(ctx.state, msg, to_server) {
    Ok(s)  => { ctx.state = s; Ok(()) }
    Err(_) => {
        ctx.state = TlsState::Invalid;
        Err("Invalid state")
    }
}
```

# Implementation notes

When parsing messages, if a field is an integer corresponding to an enum of known values,
it is not parsed as an enum type, but as an integer. While this complicates accesses,
it allows to read invalid values and continue parsing (for an IDS, it's better to read
values than to get a generic parse error).

## FAQ and limitations

### Can the parser decrypt a TLS session if I provide the master secret ?

No, it's not implemented

### Does the parser support TLS compression ?

No. Note that most TLS implementations disabled it after the FREAK attack, so
while detecting compression in `ServerHello` is possible in tls-parser, it
should probably be interpreted as an alert.

### Where are located the TLS CipherSuites ?

They are built when running `cargo build`.

To ease updating the list from the
[IANA TLS
parameters](http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xml),
a script is provided ([scripts/extract-iana-ciphers.py](scripts/extract-iana-ciphers.py)).
This script will download and pre-parse the list from IANA, and produce a file containing
all ciphersuites names and parameters.

During the build, [build.rs](build.rs) parses this file and produces a static,
read-only hash table of all known ciphers and their properties.
